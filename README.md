PAYMENT API DOCUMENTATION

Project Overview

This Payment API is a backend service designed to facilitate secure, seamless, and multi-currency online payments between customers and merchants. The API will handle payment initiation, transaction processing, refunds, and dispute resolution, while ensuring compliance with security and financial regulations.
The goal is to provide a developer-friendly interface that can be integrated into e-commerce platforms, mobile applications, and other services requiring payment processing.

Functional Requirements

Core Features
1. User Management:
    Create and manage merchant and customer accounts.
    Secure authentication (JWT or OAuth2).
2. Payment Processing:
    Initiate payments with support for multiple currencies.
    Process credit/debit card and possibly mobile money payments.
    Return payment status (success, pending, failed).
3. Refund Management:
    Initiate partial or full refunds.
    Track refund status.
4. Dispute Handling:
    Allow customers or merchants to open disputes.
    Track dispute resolution progress and outcomes.
5. Transaction History:
    Retrieve a list of all transactions for a user or merchant.
    Provide detailed transaction records.
6. Notifications:
    Send payment confirmation, refund, and dispute updates via webhooks or email.

Technical Requirements

1. Backend
    Framework: Django + Django REST Framework (DRF) for API development.
    Database: MySQL (for relational data storage, ACID compliance).
    ORM: Django ORM for database operations.
    Authentication: This is done with the JWT-based authentication which is djangorestframework-simplejwt.
    API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI for endpoint documentation.
    Filtering & Pagination: django-filter for search/filtering, DRF pagination.
    Security:
        HTTPS for encrypted communication.
        CSRF protection (for web-based interactions).
        Data validation and sanitisation.
2. Payment Gateway Integration
    Use a sandbox or live API from a provider like Stripe, Paystack, or Flutterwave.
    Store only minimal payment-related data — sensitive card details must never be stored.
3. Infrastructure
    Environment: Python 3.11+, Virtual Environment.
    Hosting: Cloud-based (AWS, Render, or Railway).
    Version Control: Git + GitHub for source code management.
    Environment Variables: .env for sensitive configs (API keys, DB credentials).
    Logging & Monitoring: Django logging + Sentry or similar for error tracking.
4. Testing
    Unit tests for all core functionalities (pytest or Django’s built-in test framework).
    Mock payment gateway responses for testing without real transactions.
